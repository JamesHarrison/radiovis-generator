{"note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"## RadioVIS Generator\r\n\r\nThis is a small gem which allows you to quickly and simply generate slides (comprising of a complex, rendered and composited image, and some text) customised for your station from an SVG source file, a set of substitutions (which can be dynamically driven) and optionally an image to composite behind the SVG output.\r\n\r\nThe generator also includes a framework for specifying slide durations and intelligently pushing them to your Stomp broker.\r\n\r\nIt's designed to let any station plug it directly into their infrastructure with a minimal amount of coding and a simple process for non-technical content creators.\r\n\r\n### What is RadioVIS?\r\n\r\nRadioVIS is a [RadioDNS](http://radiodns.org/) application. It's designed for hybrid radio receivers (Broadcast audio plus IP back channel) but can be used on other platforms such as the internet in addition. A [much better description](http://radiodns.org/about-radiodns/) can be found on the RadioDNS website.\r\n\r\nSimply put (though if you want the spec, [it's here](http://radiodns.org/documentation/)) RadioVIS lets receivers and audio player software show an image and a line of text next to your station, and allows for the use of push technologies to update which image and text the receiver is displaying at a given point in time. This allows for content mapped to the output of your station (such as 'Now Playing' information or information on the current show) to be generated and displayed to your users.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nRadioVIS Generator depends on Inkscape (which does not require a GUI) and the ImageMagick project (the 'convert' and 'composite' binaries).\r\n\r\nAside from those two tools, Ruby is required, along with RubyGems. Recent versions are recommended - 1.9 or greater. There's a couple of gem dependencies (stomp and trollop).\r\n\r\nYou'll also need a Stomp broker, though this can be on another system. A service like Apache ActiveMQ (for which an example configuration for RadioVIS is included) or Apache Apollo will work perfectly for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe generator will write images to any given path, but you'll need to be able to serve these images up over HTTP, so you'll need a webserver like nginx (recommended) or Apache set up and configured.\r\n\r\nRadioVIS Generator is tested on Linux. Other operating systems are supported in principle, but not tested.\r\n\r\n## Installation and Usage\r\n\r\nInstalling is simple. Install the dependencies (on Ubuntu, that's `sudo apt-get install imagemagick inkscape` - add `ruby1.9-full` if you're missing Ruby), and then simply install the gem with `gem install radiovis-generator`. Congratulations, you're good to go!\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can test the installation out by using the simple command line program bundled with the generator - see `radiovis-generator --help` for options. This will cycle between the slides provided by the gem, and is intended as a really simple starting point for your own runner.\r\n\r\nFor example, to serve up some images locally for testing, you might run something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nradiovis-generator -a \"stomp-password\" -b \"fm/ce1/c08f/10320\" -p \"/home/james/radiovis/\" -u \"http://localhost/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Simple Usage\r\n\r\nRadioVIS Generator comes bundled with a couple of basic templates - one which shows two pieces of information (intended for Now Playing slides), and one which shows just a large title. These will get you off the ground, or at least show you how to customise your slides.\r\n\r\nTo run RadioVIS Generator is very simple. I'm going to assume you can set up a folder on your system and point your web server at it, and that you've got a Stomp broker running. If this is all correct, then you can run a simple demo by creating a file like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequire 'rubygems'\r\nrequire 'radiovis-generator'\r\ngen = RadioVISGenerator::Generator.new\r\noptions = {\r\n  slides: [RadioVISGenerator::BrandingSlide.new, RadioVISGenerator::NowPlayingSlide.new],\r\n  url: 'http://localhost/radiovis/', # The path on your web server pointing at..\r\n  path: '/tmp/radiovis-output',       # This path on your filesystem!\r\n  broadcast_parameters: 'fm/ecc/pi/freq', # See the RadioVIS spec for how to generate this.\r\n  username: 'system',   # These details are for your Stomp broker.\r\n  password: 'manager',\r\n  host: 'localhost',\r\n  port: 61613\r\n}\r\ngen.run(options)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this file will perpetually serve up RadioVIS images and text, and send out Stomp messages. You can use a tool like CasterPlay's RadioVIS Monitor to check everything is working. The console output will also tell you more or less what it's doing, or at least let you know if it's obviously not working!\r\n\r\n### Customising\r\n\r\nCustomisation should simply be a matter of making a new subclass of `RadioVISGenerator::Slide`, making a new SVG file and if required a background image, and then adding the new subclass to your runner rotation. So let's say we want a simple slide which is going to have a rotating title and a background image.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MyCustomSlide < RadioVISGenerator::Slide\r\n  def generate\r\n    return {\r\n      '$$TITLE$$' => ['Some cool text!', 'Some other cool text!'].shuffle.first\r\n    }\r\n  end\r\n  # We don't want this one displayed so often.\r\n  def redisplay_delay\r\n    20\r\n  end\r\n  # Specify our filename - this is messy because it's relative to the gem.\r\n  def svg_filename\r\n    return \"/some/path/to/my-custom-slide.svg\"\r\n  end\r\n  # We want a background image!\r\n  def background_image\r\n    return \"/some/path/to/my-background.png\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow all we need to do is pass `MyCustomSlide.new` to our runner as a slide to consider in the rotation and we're done! We can customise the SVG file or the background image, adjust the text we're dynamically adding in our slide class, or add new dynamic elements through the same mechanism. The only limit is the lengths to which you're willing to figure out how to do things with SVG.\r\n\r\n\r\nLoads more information on how to make your own custom slides can be found in the [RDoc documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/radiovis-generator/RadioVISGenerator/Slide) or by simply reading the `slide.rb` file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits and Acknowledgements\r\n\r\n* This software package was developed by James Harrison, originally as part of the OCD Broadcast Content Management System for [Insanity Radio](http://insanityradio.com).\r\n* RadioDNS is supported by a [lot of people](http://radiodns.org/supporters/).\r\n* The [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) project provides the kick-ass SVG to PNG converter and a really slick SVG editor.\r\n* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) has yet to not appear in anything I've ever written.
